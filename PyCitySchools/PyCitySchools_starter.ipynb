    "1. Across the entire district, the mean math and reading scores had no significant change between school years. Over the four years, the district-wide math average stayed ~80 and the reading average stayed ~82.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schools with per-student budgets less than $615 far out-performed schools with higher budgets in the percentage of students passing both reading and math by a margin of around 30%.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Similarly, schools with less than 2500 students beat out schools with larger student bodies in the percentage of students passing both reading and math by almost 40%.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. District schools are not far behind Charter schools in the number of students passing reading. Charter schools did however largely beat district schools in the number of students passing math and students passing both subjects."
